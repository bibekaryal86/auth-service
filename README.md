* Flyway
  * Run flyway command as `./gradlew flywayMigrate -Dflyway.user=xxx -Dflyway.password=xxx`
    * For first run, append `-Dflyway.baselineOnMigrate=true` to set baseline migration
  * Clear database (DELETES EVERYTHING)
    * `./gradlew flywayMigrate -Dflyway.user=xxx -Dflyway.password=xxx -Dflyway.cleanDisabled=false`
